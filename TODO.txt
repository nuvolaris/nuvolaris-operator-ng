- Build image
- Create an operator listening to setup events
- When an event happens, it clones the plugin and register them
  - each plugin has a nuvops.json listing the plugins to register
- start the operator registering initial components
- deploy the plugin 
  - the operator can update itself restarting and registering the new components?
